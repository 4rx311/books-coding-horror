## Functional-Friendly OOP

1.	Asynchronous Construction Factory Method (using with static method)
2.	Asynchronous Initialization Pattern (with Dependency Injection / Data binding)
3.	Asynchronous Lazy Cached Property – AsyncLazy<T>
4.	Async Events (using deferrals to track asynchronous handlers)
5.	Async Disposal (to allow disposal of type’s resources)
6.	Async Completetion (similar to async initialization pattern)
